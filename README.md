Urbex Site
======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/wasinski/urbexsite.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/wasinski/urbexsite)

**This is my latest playground**, but who knows what will come out of it? ;)

Simultaneously I'm developing a [fork of this project ported to MongoDB](git@github.com:wasinski/urbexsite-mongo.git)

About
------

Urbex Site aims to be a site where urban explorers can safely exchange
abandoned (or not) locations to explore.
With most of the sites up on the net there is one problem: they are more or less
open to vandals, taggers, scrappers etc., because of that locations get ruined, and explorers don't want to share most interesting locations. This project is hopefully going to deal with that issue.

###### Tech. stack:
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- Postgresql
- Redis
- Celery

  Testing: Pytest, Factoryboy

  Provision: Vagrant & Ansible

  Frontend part is *currently* setup for React stack, but I'm focusing on the backend and API for now.

Install
------
**Vagrant** and **Ansible** v2 are required. After clone run `vagrant up` -> `vagrant ssh`
and `run` on the guest machine. This should bring up a **tmux** session with 4 terminals,
including **Django** on the backend and **Webpack** on the front.
