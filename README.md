Urbex Site
======
About
------
Urbex Site is heading to be a site where urban explorers can safely exchange
abandoned (or not) locations to explore.
With most of the sites up on the net there is one problem: they are more or less
open to vandals, because of that locations get ruined, and advance explorers
stop posting new locations. This project is hopefully going to solve that.

This project is using Django at its core with Django REST Framework
connected to React stack (Redux, React Router)

#### Want to help?
We are just starting out, so any kind of contribution is welcome.
You know Django or React? Great!
Still learning them? Why not do this by doing? **Beginners are welcome!**

Install
------
Vagrant and Ansible v2 are required. After clone run `vagrant up` -> `vagrant ssh`
and `run` on the guest machine. This should bring up a tmux session with 4 terminals,
including Django on the backend and Webpack on the front.
